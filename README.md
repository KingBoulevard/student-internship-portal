## FOR THIS BACKEND CENTRED COMMIT
Open it and navigate to the backend folder using the terminal, then run the "npm install" command in it

## To run the project correctly
After make sure you have changed the details in the .env and db.js(in the config sub-folder) files. You need to have two terminals, the first one for the backend and the second one for the frontend. Both work using the "npm run dev" command

## Login
Login is meant to be dynamic and will recognize users based on the characteristics of their emails. Take note that the admin emails have not been improved and run on default values. To see these values check the authController.js file in the controller sub-folder in the backend folder
